## Why study probability?

-   Because probability is an essential component of *inductive reasoning* (i.e., reasoning with probabilities) and inductive reasoning is the foundation of *scientific reasoning*. Unfortunately, humans suck at inductive reasoning; we suffer from "probability blindness" and are often fallacious when reasoning with probabilities.
-   Because *probability theory* is the foundation of *statistical inference* (i.e., learning from data under uncertainty), the cornerstone of modern data analysis.

## Inductive vs. deductive reasoning

-   Logic is the study of reasoning (i.e., drawing inferences/conclusions from known or assumed facts/premises).
-   An argument is a set of propositions/claims; more specifically a set of premises together with a conclusion.

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{premise} \\
& \text{premise} \\
& \overline{\therefore \text{conclusion}}
\end{align}
$$

-   An inference is the process of reasoning from the premises of an argument to its conclusion.
-   Propositions/claims are sentences that can either be true or false (xor).
-   Inductive reasoning is distinct from deductive reasoning; the truth of the conclusion of a \[valid\] deductive argument is certain, if the premises are true; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of a \[strong\] inductive argument is probable, if the premises are true.
-   Arguments/inferences are either correct or incorrect. If they are correct then their premises support their conclusion. If they are incorrect then their premises do not support their conclusion.
-   Premises and conclusions, on the other hand, are true or false depending on whether they are in accord with reality.
-   A deductive valid argument is one whose premises guarantee the truth of its conclusion. The conclusion follows with CERTAINTY from the premises. The premises entail the conclusion.
-   An inductive \[strong/weak\] argument is one whose premises do not guarantee the truth of its conclusion but only that its conclusion is true with some \[high/low\] probability. The conclusion follows NOT with CERTAINTY, but only with some \[high/low\] PROBABILITY, from the premises (a "risky" inference). The premises partially entail the conclusion (strong/weak logical support).
-   Probability as the degree of partial entailment (or logical support) of a conclusion, given the premises.
-   How strong is the inference? What is the probability of the conclusion, given the premises? Probability theory helps us answer this question!
-   How high does the probability/how strong does the inference have to be before it's rational/reasonable to accept the conclusion? Decision theory (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) helps us answer this question!
-   Modus ponens

$$
\begin{align}
& A \rightarrow B \\
& A \\
& \overline{\therefore B}
\end{align}
$$

-   Modus tollens

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A \rightarrow B \\
& \text{not-}A \\
& \overline{\therefore \text{not-}B}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Probability as a mathematical function

In mathematics, a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is an assignment of an element $y$ of $Y$ to each element $x$ of $X$.

INPUT: $x$

FUNCTION: $f$

OUTPUT: $y = f(x)$

$f: X \rightarrow Y$

Kolmogorov axioms vs. Cox's theorem

Probability theory is the study of probability as a mathematical object. It is the foundation of statistical inference (learning from data).

## Interpretations of probability

objective vs. subjective

event vs. proposition language

## Mutually exclusive events

## Independent events

## The rules of probability

negation

disjunction (OR, sum/addition rule)

conjunction (AND, product/multiplication rule)

## Conditional probability

## Inverse probability: Bayes' theorem (or Bayes' rule)

From probability theory to statistical inference

$\text{posterior} = \text{prior} \times \text{likelihood} \div \text{evidence}$
