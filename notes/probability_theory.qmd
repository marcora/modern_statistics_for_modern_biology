## Why study probability?

-   **Probability** is the foundation of **inductive reasoning** (i.e., reasoning with probabilities).
-   **Scientific reasoning** is inductive. With a few exceptions (e.g., mathematics and computer programming) nearly all reasoning is inductive.
-   Unfortunately, humans suffer from "probability blindness" and are often incorrect when reasoning with probabilities.
-   **Probability theory** is a mathematical framework for correct inductive reasoning.
-   Probability theory is the foundation of **statistical inference** and **causal inference**.

## Logic: Inductive vs. deductive reasoning

-   **Logic** is the study of **correct reasoning**.
-   Reasoning is the process of drawing a conclusion/inference from a set of premises.
-   Reasoning is put into words in the form of an argument.
-   An **argument** is a set of statements/propositions; more specifically **a set of premises and a conclusion**.

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{premise}_1 \\
& \text{premise}_2 \\
& \ldots \\
& \text{premise}_n \\
& \overline{\therefore \text{conclusion}}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\text{IF premise}_1\ \text{AND premise}_2 \ldots \ \text{AND premise}_n \ \text{THEN conclusion}
$$

-   A statement/proposition is a sentence that asserts a claim that is either true or false based on its correspondence with reality/the state of affairs in the world.
-   In an argument, the premises are the evidence given in support of the conclusion. The conclusion is the statement/proposition that the argument seeks to prove as definitely true (**deductive argument**) or likely true (**inductive argument**) if all premises are true.
-   If it is impossible for the premises to all be true and the conclusion still be false, then the argument is deductive.
-   If it is possible for the premises to all be true and the conclusion still be false, then the argument is inductive.
-   In an inductive argument (e.g., an inductive generalization, a causal argument, or reasoning by analogy), the conclusion follows from the premises with likelihood/probability, never with certainty.
-   An inductive argument is defeasable, i.e., subject to revision (conclusion becomes more or less likely/probable) in light of new evidence.

-   A **valid deductive argument** guarantees a definitely true conclusion if all premises are true, i.e., in valid deductive argument the premises fully entail the conclusion. When all premises are true and the deductive argument is valid, it is also **sound**.
-   A **strong inductive argument** guarantees a likely true conclusion if all premises are true, i.e., in a strong inductive argument the premises partially entail the conclusion. When all premises are true and the inductive argument is strong, it is also **cogent**.
-   How likely is the conclusion given the premises? Probability theory can help us find the answer!
-   How likely does the conclusion need to be before it's rational to accept it? Decision theory can help us find the answer!

## Logical operators and truth tables

-   A statement/proposition is simple if it cannot be broken down into other statements/propositions.
-   A statement/proposition is composite if it comprises multiple simple or composite statements/propositions connected by logical operators.
-   A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more statements/propositions.
-   Commonly used logical operators:
    -   $\text{and} \quad \land$
    -   $\text{or} \quad \lor$
    -   $\text{not} \quad \lnot$
    -   $\text{if-then} \quad \rightarrow$

## Probability: Proposition vs. event language

When using inductive reasoning to answer a probabilistic question, there are two ways of asking the same question:

1.  *"What is the probability that the coin will land heads?"*
    -   **Proposition**: *"the coin will land heads"*
    -   **Question**: What is the probability that this **proposition** is **true**?
    -   A proposition is a claim that is either true or false based on its correspondence with reality/the state of affairs in the world.
    -   Better fit for the logical or bayesian/"subjective" interpretations of probability.
2.  *"What is the probability of the coin landing heads?"*
    -   **Event**: *"the coin landing heads"*
    -   **Question**: What is the probability that this **event** will **occur**?
    -   An event is a state of affairs in the world that either occurs or doesn't occur.
    -   Better fit for the classical or frequentist/"objective" interpretations of probability.

## Set theory

-   A **set** is a collection of objects, typically referred to as **elements** (or members) of the set.
-   The objects within a set can be anything---numbers, letters, people, animals, sets, or any other entities---as long as they are well-defined and distinct, e.g.:
    -   $\{1, 3, 5, 7\}$
    -   **natural numbers**: $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\ldots \}\quad \text{or} \quad \{0, 1,2,3,\ldots \}$
    -   **integers**: $\mathbb{Z} = \{ \ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$
    -   **real numbers**: $\mathbb{R}$
    -   $\{ a, b, c, d \}$
    -   $\{ \{1, 3, 5, 7 \} , \{ a, b, c, d \} \}$
    -   $\{ ⚀, ⚁, ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ \}$
    -   $\{ ⚀⚀, ⚀⚁, ⚀⚂, ⚀⚃, ⚀⚄, ⚀⚅, ⚁⚀, ⚁⚁, ⚁⚂, ⚁⚃, ⚁⚄, ⚁⚅, ⚂⚀, ⚂⚁, ⚂⚂, ⚂⚃, ⚂⚄, ⚂⚅, \\ ⚃⚀, ⚃⚁, ⚃⚂, ⚃⚃, ⚃⚄, ⚃⚅, ⚄⚀, ⚄⚁, ⚄⚂, ⚄⚃, ⚄⚄, ⚄⚅, ⚅⚀, ⚅⚁, ⚅⚂, ⚅⚃, ⚅⚄, ⚅⚅ \}$
    -   $\{ 🐱, 🐶, 🐰, 🐭, 🐻, 🐷, 🐴, 🐤, 🐵, 🐟, 🦖, 🐸, 🦑, 🦀, 🐞, 👽, 🎅 \}$
    -   $\{ 🟥, 🟩, 🟦, 🔴, 🟢, 🔵 \}$
-   Sets can be combined using set operators:
    -   $A = \{ x : x \in A \}$
    -   $B = \{ x : x \in B \}$
    -   Union: $A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \lor x \in B \}$
    -   Intersection: $A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \land x \in B \}$
    -   Complement: $A^\complement = \{ x : x \notin A \}$
-   Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be disjoint if they have no element in common. Equivalently, they are said to be disjoint if their intersection is the empty set, i.e., $A \cap B = \emptyset$. For example, $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $\{ 4, 5, 6 \}$ are disjoint sets*,* while $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $\{ 3, 4, 5 \}$ are not disjoint sets. Two or more sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are said to be disjoint if any two sets are disjoint.

## Probability as a mathematical object

Probability theory is the study of probability as a mathematical object.

Probability as a function that satisfies the axioms of probability.

In mathematics, a function is an assignment/mapping of an element $y$ of a set $Y$ to each element $x$ of a set $X$.

FUNCTION: $f: X \rightarrow Y$

INPUT: $x$

OUTPUT: $y = f(x)$

A probabilistic model consists of three components: the sample space $S$, the event space $E$, and the probability function $P$.

The **sample space** $S$ is the set of outcomes of the "experiment" (random phenomenon/stochastic process) being modeled. Outcomes in the sample space must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive and \[art\] at the right "granularity".

The power set of a set $S$ is the set of all subsets of $S$, including the empty set $\emptyset$ and $S$ itself.

The **event space** $E$ is the power set of the sample space $S$.

An **event** $A$ is a subset of the sample space $S$:

$A \subseteq S$

and therefore also an element of the event space $E$:

$A \in E$

$P$ is a function from the event space $E$ to the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$:

$P : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

$P(A)$ is the probability of event (or proposition) $A$, i.e., a real number.

A real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a length, area, volume, mass and temperature.

$P(A)$ is a measure of uncertainty, i.e., the likelihood that event $A$ will occur or that proposition $A$ is true.

## The axioms of probability

Probability is any function $P : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following axioms (Kolmogorov axioms; see also [Cox's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_theorem) as an alternative):

-   $P(A) \ge 0 \quad \forall A \in E$
-   $P(S) = 1$
-   $\text{if} \quad A_1, A_2, \ldots \ \text{are disjoint sets/mutually exclusive events} \quad \text{then} \quad P(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)$

All other rules/properties of any probability function P are derived from these axioms, for example:

$0 \le P(A) \le 1 \quad \forall A \in E$

$P(\emptyset) = 0$

$\text{if} \quad A \subseteq B \quad \text{then} \quad P(A) \le P(B)$

## Example: A single toin coss

Consider a single coin toss and assume that the coin will either land heads ($H$) or tails ($T$) (but not both):

$S = \{H, T\}$

$E = \{ \emptyset, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H,T\} \}$

If we assume that the coin is fair (i.e., it has equal probability of landing heads or tails):

$P(\emptyset) = 0$

$P(\{H,T\}) = P(S) = 1$

$P(\{H,T\}) = P(\{H\}) + P(\{T\}) = 1$

$P(\{H\}) = P(\{T\}) = 0.5$

## Mutually exclusive events

If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets then they are said to be mutually exclusive events, i.e., events/propositions that cannot occur/be true at the same time. For example, when you toss a coin, you can only get heads or tails, but not both.

If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, then:

$P(A\ \cap \ B) = P(\emptyset) = 0$

## The rules of probability

### Negation

$P(A^{\complement}) = 1 - P(A)$

Alternative notation for $P(A^{\complement})$:

-   $P(\text{not-}A)$
-   $P(A')$
-   $P(\overline{A})$
-   $P(\lnot A)$

### Disjunction (sum/addition rule)

$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

Alternative notation for $P(A \cup B)$:

-   $P(A\ \text{or}\ B)$

If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

The disjunction rule is commutative: $P(A \cup B) = P(B \cup A)$

## Conditional probability

$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

$P(A \mid B) \ne P(B \mid A)$

### Conjunction (product/multiplication rule)

$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)$

Alternative notation for $P(A \cap B)$:

-   $P(A\ \text{and} \ B)$
-   $P(A,B)$
-   $P(AB)$

If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$

The conjunction rule is commutative: $P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A)$

## Inverse probability: Bayes' theorem (or Bayes' rule)

$P(A\ \text{and} \ B) = P(A) \times P(B \mid A)$

$P(B\ \text{and} \ A) = P(B) \times P(A \mid B)$

$P(A\ \text{and}\ B) = P(B\ \text{and}\ A)$

$P(A) \times P(B \mid A) = P(B) \times P(A \mid B)$

$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B \mid A)}{P(B)}$
