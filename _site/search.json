The conclusion is the statement/proposition that the argument seeks to prove as definitely true (deductive argument) or likely true (inductive argument) if the premises are true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA valid deductive argument guarantees a definitely true conclusion if the premises are true, i.e., in valid deductive argument the premises fully entail the conclusion. When the premises are true and the deductive argument is valid, it is also sound.\nA strong inductive argument guarantees a likely true conclusion if the premises are true, i.e., in a strong inductive argument the premises partially entail the conclusion. When the premises are true and the inductive argument is strong, it is also cogent.\nHow likely is the conclusion given the premises? Probability theory can help us find the answer!\nHow likely does the conclusion need to be before it’s rational to accept it? Decision theory (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) can help us find the answer!"
