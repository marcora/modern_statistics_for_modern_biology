The conclusion is the claim that the argument seeks to prove as definitely true (deductive argument) or likely true (inductive argument) assuming that the premises are true.\nConclusion indicator words: thus, ergo, hence, therefore, thus, consequently, it follows that, etc.\nPremise indicator words: since, because, given that, follows from, assuming that, considering that, etc.\nA deductive argument seeks to prove that the conclusion is definitely true assuming that the premises are true. In contrast, an inductive argument seeks to prove that the conclusion is likely true assuming that the premises are true.\nPremises and conclusions are either true or false depending on whether they are in accord with reality.\nA valid deductive argument ensures the conclusion is definitely true assuming that the premises are true. The conclusion follows with certainty from the premises, as the premises fully entail the conclusion.\nA strong inductive argument ensures the conclusion is likely true assuming that the premises are true. The conclusion follows with high probability from the premises, as the premises partially entail the conclusion.\nProbability can be understood as the measure of the degree to which a conclusion follows from the premises. It indicates the strength of the entailment between the premises and the conclusion.\nHow likely is the conclusion given the premises? Probability theory can help us find the answer!\nHow likely does the conclusion need to be before it’s rational to accept it? Decision theory (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) can help us find the answer!\nModus ponens:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& A \\rightarrow B \\\\\n& A \\\\\n& \\overline{\\therefore B}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nModus tollens:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A \\rightarrow B \\\\\n& \\text{not-}A \\\\\n& \\overline{\\therefore \\text{not-}B}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"
