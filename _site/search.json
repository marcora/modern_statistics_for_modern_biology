The conclusion is the statement/proposition that the argument seeks to prove as definitely true (deductive argument) or likely true (inductive argument) if all premises are true.\nIf it is impossible for the premises to all be true and the conclusion still be false, then the argument is deductive.\nIf it is possible for the premises to all be true and the conclusion still be false, then the argument is inductive.\nIn an inductive argument (e.g., an inductive generalization, a causal argument, or reasoning by analogy), the conclusion follows from the premises with likelihood/probability, never with certainty.\nAn inductive argument is defeasable, i.e., subject to revision (conclusion becomes more or less likely/probable) in light of new evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA valid deductive argument guarantees a definitely true conclusion if all premises are true, i.e., in valid deductive argument the premises fully entail the conclusion. When all premises are true and the deductive argument is valid, it is also sound.\nA strong inductive argument guarantees a likely true conclusion if all premises are true, i.e., in a strong inductive argument the premises partially entail the conclusion. When all premises are true and the inductive argument is strong, it is also cogent.\nHow likely is the conclusion given the premises? Probability theory can help us find the answer!\nHow likely does the conclusion need to be before it’s rational to accept it? Decision theory can help us find the answer!"
